## 😞 The Problem 
<!-- content goes below -->
New York City’s 311 system was created to streamline access to non-emergency services, but today, much of that information remains invisible to the public. Residents cannot easily see what issues their neighbors report, and those who rely on flyers, private chats, or closed social media groups for local events often leave many, especially elders and immigrants, excluded. Existing solutions like the 311 app offer limited one-way reporting without fostering neighborhood connection. Meanwhile, fragmented platforms and inaccessible tools contribute to a growing sense of disconnection in NYC’s diverse communities. Residents lack a unified, simple, and social space to share and discover both neighborhood issues and events.

## 📝 Summary
<!-- content goes below -->
Our project is a community-driven web app that reimagines NYC’s 311 experience by combining issue reporting and local event sharing on a public, interactive map. It empowers everyday New Yorkers to easily post, view, and engage with pins across their neighborhoods—making civic participation more visible, collaborative, and accessible for all, especially offline and underserved households.

## 🤔 Our Hypothesis
<!-- content goes below -->
We believe the core challenge is that New Yorkers cannot see hyper‑local issues and events quickly enough to respond in fragmented channels and disappear before most neighbors notice. As NYC‑based students who navigate these blind spots daily and have recently gained full‑stack development skills, we bring both lived experience and technical capacity to the problem. We hypothesize that a crowd‑sourced, real‑time map that layers 311‑style infrastructure reports with community‑led events will collapse the current information gap: by giving residents a single, glanceable interface where they can post, view, and discuss neighborhood happenings, technology can transform scattered data into collective awareness and coordinated action.

## 📱 Product Overview
<!-- content goes below -->
Every New Yorker can glance at a map and instantly understand what is happening on their block—whether a pothole was just reported, a street light was fixed, or a free food‑drive starts at noon—so they feel informed, connected, and empowered to take action.

## 🏙️  Mission Statement 
<!-- content goes below -->
We’re ending loneliness in New York City by bridging the visibility gap between neighbors. Our platform surfaces hyper-local events and issues in real time—so you can spot what’s happening on your block and jump into the conversation. The goal: timely information that sparks connection, resilience, and a stronger sense of community for every New Yorker.

## 🫂 Who do we serve?
<!-- content goes below -->
Our primary stakeholders are all New York City residents—from tenants and small‑business owners to mutual‑aid volunteers and local agencies—because each group both contributes to and benefits from timely neighborhood information. To shape the solution, we surveyed classmates at The Marcy Lab School and respondents agreed to test an MVP and share feedback. The core users are anyone with a web browser or smartphone, while the beneficiaries also include mutual‑aid groups that can boost turnout and city departments that gain clearer community signals. We will keep stakeholders involved through an in‑app “Give Feedback” button attached to every map pin, monthly release notes, and quarterly virtual town‑halls where we present usage data and gather feature requests. Ethical, inclusive design guides every choice: the interface is mobile‑first, keyboard‑navigable, and screen‑reader friendly with ARIA labels. We aim to implement language toggles to include all members of the city, no matter what language they speak.

## 👥 User-Stories
<!-- content goes below -->
**Must-Haves** (Without these features, the application will not be useful)
- **As a User, I can…** pin a report or event on a shared map with a title, photo, and geolocation.
- **As a User, I can…** view a feed of nearby reports and events in real-time.
- **As a User, I can…** comment on or upvote others’ posts to show support or ask for updates.

**Nice-to-Haves** (When time is running short, these features will get cut)
- **As a User, I can…** filter pins by type (e.g., potholes, cleanups, food giveaways).
- **As a User, I can…** get notifications for nearby updates or posts I follow.
- **As a User, I can…** earn badges or streaks for contributing (gamification layer).

## 🧗‍♂️ Key Technical Challenge
<!-- content goes below -->
- **Technical dependencies:** Map integration with Google Maps API and Google’s quota limits, as well as backend data flow and performance.
- **Team dependencies:** Coordination between the team, as multiple tasks will be worked on simultaneously (frontend, backend, and API integrations).
- **External dependencies:** Any third-party libraries (such as Cloudinary for image handling) or services may pose challenges if their performance or availability impacts our timeline.

## 🏋🏽 Extension Opportunities 
<!-- content goes below -->
Looking to the future, there are several ways to expand, iterate, and scale our solution. One potential opportunity is to develop a React Native mobile app to extend the reach of our platform. We could also explore auto-submitting eligible issue pins to the NYC 311 system, adding a multilingual interface to broaden accessibility, and creating analytics dashboards for communities to track their impact. These enhancements would help the solution grow in impact over time, further establishing it as an essential tool for NYC residents. As the demand for this solution grows, it could become a staple in the city's civic tech infrastructure, benefiting a broader audience and strengthening community engagement.
